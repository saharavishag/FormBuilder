<body>Welcome to the Form Builder <br><br><br>
    The Client is not connected to the Server yet so you can see demo data. <br>
    In The Form Builder page you can see submitted field but when you save the form the page will reset.<br>
    <br><br>
    The server is a TCP server but the connection is not stable.<br>
    The database procedures works.<br>
    For now, Get(SELECT) procedures in SQL wil print the demo data to the console <br>
    and the Set(INSERT) procedures change the data in the tables.
